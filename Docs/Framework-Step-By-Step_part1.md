# Playwright + TypeScript Automation Framework 

# Step-By-Step Guide

## Building a Test Automation Framework with Playwright and TypeScript

### Introduction

This guide walks you step by step through setting up a complete automated testing framework using Playwright and TypeScript, and using an AI coding agent to help generate configuration, utilities, and tests. It uses a demo project called `PLAYWRIGHT_OPENCART_AI` as the running example, but the same approach can be adapted to other projects.

The original instructions, commands, configuration values, and overall flow from the source document are preserved. The AI prompts have been refined for clarity, consistency, and better results when used with an AI coding agent.

## How to Read This Document

- **PROMPT** sections contain text you can copy and paste into your AI coding agent, such as Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, CommandCode, or OpenCode.
- **Code** sections contain file contents or commands that you type or paste directly into your project.
- **Note** sections call out important warnings or clarifications.
- **Why this matters** sections explain the purpose behind a step so you understand not only how to do it, but why it is needed.

# Glossary: Key Terms Used in This Guide

If you're new to test automation, skim this section first. You can always come back to it as terms come up later in the guide.

| Term | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Node.js** | A program that lets you run JavaScript/TypeScript code outside a web browser. It is required to install and run Playwright. |
| **npm** | “Node Package Manager.” The tool installed together with Node.js that is used to download and install code libraries, such as the ones used in this framework. |
| **Playwright** | An open-source tool by Microsoft that automates web browsers — it can open pages, click buttons, fill forms, and check results, which is exactly what automated tests need to do. |
| **TypeScript** | A version of JavaScript that adds type checking, which helps catch mistakes before you run your code. Playwright supports writing tests in TypeScript or plain JavaScript; this guide uses TypeScript. |
| **VS Code** | Visual Studio Code — a free, popular code editor used to write and run the project files in this guide. |
| **Coding agent / AI agent** | An AI assistant, such as Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, CommandCode, or OpenCode, that can write or edit code when you give it a written instruction (a “prompt”). |
| **Prompt** | The instructions you type or paste to an AI coding agent describing what you want it to build or change. |
| **Page Object Model (POM)** | A common way of organizing test code where each web page, such as Login or Cart, has its own file describing how to interact with it. These files live in the `pages/` folder. |
| **Fixtures** | Reusable setup and clean-up code that multiple tests can share, for example logging in before a test starts. These live in the `fixtures/` folder. |
| **Allure Report** | A tool that turns raw test results into an easy-to-read HTML report with charts, history, and screenshots. |
| **CI/CD** | “Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment” — automatically building and testing your code whenever it changes, typically using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins. |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | A way for AI agents to directly use tools such as a web browser through Playwright, allowing the AI to interact with a real page while generating tests. |
| **Docker** | A tool that packages your project and everything it needs to run into a portable “container,” so it behaves consistently across environments. |
| **`.env` file** | A plain-text file that stores configuration values and settings, such as URLs and test credentials, separately from your code. |
| **`.gitignore`** | A file that tells Git which files or folders to exclude from version control, such as `node_modules` or generated reports. |

# Prerequisites (Manual Actions/Steps)

Before you start building the framework, install the following tools on your computer. Each one plays a specific role in the setup.

## Install

1. **Node.js (latest)** — https://nodejs.org/en — required to run Playwright and npm commands.
2. **Visual Studio Code (latest)** — https://code.visualstudio.com/ — the code editor you'll use throughout this guide.
3. **Coding Agent** — Claude Code / GitHub Copilot / CommandCode / OpenCode or any other AI coding agent. This is the AI assistant that will generate files for you whenever a step includes a prompt.

> **Why this matters:** Node.js is the engine that runs everything else in this guide, VS Code is where you'll view and edit files, and the coding agent is what turns the written prompts into real code.

## Install Playwright Using the VS Code Terminal

Open a terminal inside VS Code:

**Terminal → New Terminal**

Run:

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

This command downloads Playwright and walks you through a short setup wizard.

Choose the following options when prompted:

1. **Do you want to use TypeScript or JavaScript?** → `TypeScript`
2. **Where to put your end-to-end tests?** → `tests`
3. **Add a GitHub Actions workflow? (Y/n)** → `true`
4. **Install Playwright browsers?** → `true`

> **Why this matters:** This wizard creates the basic Playwright project skeleton for you — the config file, an example test, and, if selected, a ready-made GitHub Actions workflow file — so you don't have to build it from scratch.

## Install Other Dependencies

Create a file named `env_setup.bat` in the project root.

This file contains the commands below so anyone on the team can install the required dependencies in one go instead of typing each command separately.

### Commands — place inside `env_setup.bat`

```bat
npm install dotenv
npm install @faker-js/faker
npm install luxon
npm install ajv csv-parse xlsx
npm install @axe-core/playwright
npm install allure-playwright
npm install -D @types/node
npx playwright install
npm install mysql2
```

### Quick Reference — What Each Package Is For

1. `dotenv` — loads settings from your `.env` file into your code.
2. `@faker-js/faker` — generates realistic fake test data such as names, emails, and addresses.
3. `luxon` — handles dates and times.
4. `ajv`, `csv-parse`, `xlsx` — validate JSON data and read CSV/Excel test-data files.
5. `@axe-core/playwright` — adds accessibility checks to your tests.
6. `allure-playwright` — produces the Allure report used later in this guide.
7. `@types/node` — gives TypeScript awareness of Node.js built-in features.
8. `playwright install` — downloads the actual browsers Playwright will control.
9. `mysql2` — lets your tests connect to a MySQL database.

Run the `env_setup.bat` file from the terminal.

> **Note:** You only need to run `env_setup.bat` once per machine, or again later if new dependencies are added to the list.

# Step by Step: Building the Framework

With the prerequisites installed, follow these 13 steps in order.

- Steps marked **Manual** are performed by you.
- Steps marked **Using Prompt** can be handed to your AI coding agent.

---

## Step 1 — Create the Project Folder Structure

**Manual or Using Prompt**

> **Why this matters:** A consistent folder structure keeps configuration, test data, page objects, and reports separated and easy to find as the project grows.

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

```text
Create the required folder and file structure for the project root `PLAYWRIGHT_OPENCART_AI`.

Use the target structure shown in the supplied project context/document.

Requirements:
- Create only the required folders and placeholder files.
- Preserve all existing project files unless they must be created or updated.
- Do not delete or overwrite existing implementation files unnecessarily.
- Keep the structure organized for Playwright + TypeScript automation covering Web, API, and DB testing.
- Use the existing project naming conventions.
- After creating the structure, show the final directory tree and briefly identify any files that were newly created.
```

**Target structure:**

```
PLAYWRIGHT_OPENCART_AI/
├── .env                 
├── .gitignore                
├── api/
│   ├── endpoints/            
│   └── schemas/               
├── custom-report/             
├── fixtures/                 
├── pages/                    
├── prompts/                   
├── tests/
│   ├── web/                  
│   ├── api/                  
│   └── db/                    
├── testdata/                 
├── utils/                     
├── reports/                   
              
```

---

## Step 2 — Add or Update Configuration Files

Three configuration files control how the framework behaves:

- `playwright.config.ts` — Playwright test-runner settings
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript settings
- `.env` — environment values and secrets

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

```text
Create or update the following configuration files in the project:

- playwright.config.ts
- tsconfig.json
- .env

Use the exact configuration values and settings provided in this guide.

Requirements:
- Create the files if they do not already exist.
- Preserve unrelated existing configuration unless it conflicts with the required settings.
- Apply the requested settings exactly.
- Keep the configuration valid for a Playwright + TypeScript automation framework.
- Preserve the existing project structure and naming conventions.
- Do not hard-code new credentials or secrets beyond the values explicitly provided.
- After making the changes, summarize the files created or updated and the important settings applied.
```

> **Note:** Create new files if they don't already exist, then add the settings shown below.

## `playwright.config.ts`

This file tells Playwright how to run your tests — timeouts, browsers, retries, reporters, traces, screenshots, videos, and other execution settings.

```ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  timeout: 30 * 1000,   //30000 ms(30 secs)
  testDir: './tests',
  fullyParallel: true,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: [
    ['list'],                           // Detailed console output
    //['line'],                         // One-line progress output
    //['dot'],                          // Minimal console output
    ['html', { open: 'never', outputFolder: 'reports' }],        // HTML Report
    //['json', { outputFile: 'reports/results.json' }], // JSON Report
    //['junit', { outputFile: 'reports/results.xml' }]  // JUnit XML Report
    ['./utils/CustomReporter.ts'], // Custom reporter
    ['allure-playwright', { outputFolder: 'allure-results' }]  // Allure Report
  ],
  use: {
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
    video: 'retain-on-failure',
    headless: false,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 }, // Set default viewport size for consistency
    ignoreHTTPSErrors: true, // Ignore SSL errors if necessary
    permissions: ['geolocation'], // Set necessary permissions for geolocation-based tests
  },
  grep: /@master/,
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
    /*
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    }
    */
  ],
});
```

## `tsconfig.json`

This file configures how TypeScript compiles your code and defines shortcut import paths such as `@utils/` and `@pages/`.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "Node16",
    "lib": [
      "ES2022",
      "DOM"
    ],
    "moduleResolution": "node16",
    "types": [
      "node"
    ],
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": false,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "ignoreDeprecations": "6.0"    
  },
  "include": [
    "playwright.config.ts"
  ],
  "exclude": [
    "node_modules"
  ]
}
```

## `.env`

This file stores URLs, login credentials, and other settings your tests need separately from your code.

> **Note:** Values shown below, including sample credentials, are demo/test values used for this OpenCart practice project. Replace them with your own project's values and do not commit real secrets to source control.

```dotenv
#ENVIRONMENT
APP_ENV=qa # qa | prod | dev

```

## Step 3 — Add Test Data Files

**Manually**

> **Why this matters:** Keeping test data, such as login credentials or product information, in separate files instead of hard-coding it into tests makes tests reusable and easy to update.

Place test data files inside the `testdata/` folder.

```
testdata/
├── opencart_logindata.json
├── opencart_logindata.csv
└── opencart_logindata.xlsx
```

---

## Step 4 — Add API Endpoints and Schemas Under the `api/` Folder

**Manually**

> **Why this matters:** Separating API route definitions (`endpoints/`) from the JSON “shapes” you expect responses to match (`schemas/`) keeps API tests organized and makes it easy to validate responses automatically.

```
api/
├── endpoints/
│   └── routes.ts                 # Centralized endpoint URL constants
└── schemas/
    ├── product_api_schema.json    # JSON Schema for product responses
    ├── cart_api_schema.json       # JSON Schema for cart responses
    └── user_api_schema.json       # JSON Schema for user responses
```

---

## Step 5 — Create the Custom Reporter and Place It in the `utils` Folder

**Manually**

> **Why this matters:** The custom reporter referenced in `playwright.config.ts` needs an actual file to run — this is where it lives.

```
utils/
└── CustomReporter.ts
```

---

## Step 6 — Place Prompt Files in the `prompts` Folder

**Manually**

These are the written instructions you will later provide to your AI coding agent in Step 8 to generate the actual tests.

Add the following files:

1. `opencart_web_test_prompts.md`
2. `fakestore_api_test_prompts.md`
3. `db_test_prompt.md`
4. `utilitis_prompt.md`

```
promtps/
|── opencart_web_test_prompts.md    
|── fakestore_api_test_prompts.md       
|── db_test_prompt.md       
└── utilitis_prompt.md      
```

---

## Step 7 — Create Helper & Utility Files

**Manually or Using Prompt**

> **Why this matters:** Helper and utility files, such as data readers, generators, DB clients, and common helpers, provide reusable building blocks that your tests and page objects can call instead of repeating the same logic everywhere.

Supply the `utilitis_prompt.md` file to the AI agent and give it the prompt below.

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

```text
Read and follow all instructions in `prompts/utilitis_prompt.md`.

Create or update the required helper and utility files under the `utils/` folder.

Requirements:
- Follow every requirement defined in `utilitis_prompt.md`.
- Reuse existing utilities when appropriate instead of creating duplicate functionality.
- Keep the implementation compatible with Playwright + TypeScript.
- Use the existing project structure, aliases, naming conventions, and dependencies.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Do not create unnecessary utilities.
- If a required utility already exists, update it only when necessary.
- After implementation, list the utility files created or updated and briefly explain their purpose.
```

```
utils/
└── dataGenerator.ts
└── DataReader.ts
└── dbClient.ts
└── helper.ts
```

---

## Step 8 — Generate Tests Using the Prompts Stored in the `prompts` Folder

You can give the AI coding agent each prompt one at a time, or all of them at once.

> **Note:** Make sure you have installed **Playwright MCP** or the **Playwright CLI** before proceeding further. Clearly state in the prompt which mechanism the agent should use: **MCP** or **CLI**.

Refer to the Playwright CLI Documentation:
`https://playwright.dev/agent-cli/introduction`

Installation instructions:
`https://playwright.dev/agent-cli/installation`

```bash
# Installation
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli install
playwright-cli install --skills

# Verify
playwright-cli --version
```

Attach `playwright_mcp_context.md`, then provide the test prompts from the following files:

1. `opencart_web_test_prompts.md`
2. `fakestore_api_test_prompts.md`
3. `db_test_prompt.md`

## Prompt 1 — Web

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

```text
Use the supplied Playwright MCP/CLI setup and the attached `playwright_mcp_context.md` as the implementation context.

Read and follow the web test requirements in `prompts/opencart_web_test_prompts.md`.

Generate the required Playwright + TypeScript web tests.

Requirements:
- Follow the supplied test prompt exactly.
- Use Playwright MCP or Playwright CLI as specified for this task.
- Inspect the application when browser interaction is required.
- Follow the framework structure and conventions defined in the supplied context.
- Use Page Object Model and fixtures where required by the framework/context.
- Reuse existing utilities, test data, configuration, and fixtures whenever applicable.
- Do not duplicate existing framework functionality.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Add appropriate test tags and assertions based on the supplied test requirements.
- Keep tests maintainable, readable, and suitable for repeated execution.
- After implementation, list the files created or updated and explain what was implemented.
```

## Prompt 2 — API

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

```text
Use the supplied Playwright MCP/CLI setup and the attached `playwright_mcp_context.md` as the implementation context.

Read and follow the API test requirements in `prompts/fakestore_api_test_prompts.md`.

Generate the required Playwright + TypeScript API tests.

Requirements:
- Follow the supplied test prompt exactly.
- Use the existing API configuration, endpoint definitions, schemas, utilities, and fixtures where applicable.
- Reuse existing framework components instead of duplicating functionality.
- Validate HTTP status codes, response data, and schemas wherever required by the supplied test prompt.
- Keep API tests independent unless the supplied test requirements explicitly define a dependency or sequence.
- Do not hard-code environment-specific values that belong in `.env` or test-data files.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Add appropriate test tags.
- After implementation, list the files created or updated and briefly explain the API coverage implemented.
```

## Prompt 3 — DB

### PROMPT — Copy/Paste This to Your AI Coding Agent

```text
Use the supplied Playwright MCP/CLI setup and the attached `playwright_mcp_context.md` as the implementation context.

Read and follow the database test requirements in `prompts/db_test_prompt.md`.

Generate the required Playwright + TypeScript database tests.

Requirements:
- Follow the supplied database test prompt exactly.
- Use the project's existing DB configuration and `mysql2`-based database utilities where applicable.
- Reuse existing DB client/helper functionality instead of creating duplicate implementations.
- Keep database credentials and environment-specific values in `.env`.
- Validate the database results required by the supplied test prompt.
- Ensure database connections are properly handled and released.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Add appropriate test tags.
- After implementation, list the files created or updated and briefly explain the database coverage implemented.
```

> **Note:** Page Object classes (`pages/`) and fixtures (`fixtures/`) are not created manually — the coding agent generates them automatically as it builds each test, based on the context supplied in `playwright_mcp_context.md`.
